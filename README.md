# CSCI-201-M01-1
This is the code for the assingment for the CSCI 201 class module 1. 

In this program, you will create a cube object and display its volume. Create a class Cube that
includes private data members length (int), width (int), height (int), and color (string).
Create a constructor for the class that receives the length, width, height, and color. The constructor
should set the attributes with the values provided. Your class should also have public member
functions:
- Accessor methods getLength, getWidth, getHeight, and getColor returning the
appropriate attribute of the cube.
- Mutator methods setLength, setWidth, setHeight, and setColor that allow the attributes of
the cube to be changed.
- A calculateVolume method that will return the volume of the cube (volume =
length*width * height).
Create a main program that utilizes the Cube class
1. Prompt the user for the length, width, height, and color of a cube
2. Validate the information
3. After Information from the user has been validated, create an object for the Cube.
4. Using the Accessor Methods, display the cube’s information (length, width, height, color,
and volume).
5. Allow the user to change/set the length, width, height, and color. Validate any input
before calling the appropriate functions.
6. Display the cube’s attributes after the cube has been changed using the appropriate
methods.
Be sure to include in your program:
1. An appropriate header comment and annotation,
2. Input validation of any values provided by the user.
The program may be run through Safe-Assign and may be peer-reviewed. In addition to
submitting the program here, make sure you have access to it during class, so that you can send
it to a fellow student.In this program, you will create a cube object and display its volume. Create a class Cube that
